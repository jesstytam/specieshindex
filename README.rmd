`specieshindex` is a package that aims to gauge scientific influence of different species (or higher taxa) mainly using the *h*-index.

## Installation

To get this package to work, make sure you have the following packages installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Installation from GitHub
install.packages("rscopus")
install.packages("wosr")
install.packages("rbace")
install.packages("taxize")
install.packages("XML")
install.packages("httr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("tidyr")
remotes::install_github("jessicatytam/specieshindex", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

#Load the library
library(specieshindex)

#See the vignette
vignette("specieshindex")
```

## Before you start

### :mega: Connecting to Scopus

**Functions that extract data will only run if you or your institution are a paid subscriber.** Make sure you are connected to the internet via institutional access or acquire a VPN from your institution if you are working from home. Alternatively, if you are a subscriber of Scopus already, you can ignore this step.

To connect and download citation information from Scopus legally, you will **absolutely need** an API key. Here are the steps to obtain the key.

1. Go to https://dev.elsevier.com/ and click on the button `I want an API key`.
2. Create an account and log in.
3. Go to the `My API Key` tab on top of the page and click `Create API Key`.
4. Read the legal documents and check the boxes. 

#### Using your API key securely

After acquiring your key, make sure to store it safely. The following steps will enable you to save it as an environment variable, without saving it in the console or script.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

This will bring up an empty file, which is where you will save your key into.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
scopus_api_key = "a_long_string"
```

Restart your session for this to work. To retrieve your key, use `Sys.getenv()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.getenv("scopus_api_key")
#> [1] "a_long_string"
```

You can then load it to your environment as follows:

```{r}
apikey <- Sys.getenv("scopus_api_key")
```

### :mega: Connecting to Web of Science

You are required to be at your institution for this to work since the API is accessed via the IP address. Run the following line of code to do so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sid <- auth(username = NULL, password = NULL)
```

You won't have to set this again until your next session. You are required to be at your institution for this to work since the API is accessed via the IP address.

### :mega: Connecting to BASE

You must have your IP address whitelisted. You can do it [here](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/contact.php).

## Examples

Here is a quick demonstration of how the package works.

```{r, include=FALSE}
devtools::load_all(".")
```

### :abacus: Counting citation records

Multiple databases have been incorporated into `specieshindex`, namely Scopus, Web of Science, and BASE. To differentiate between them, set the `db` parameter to your desired database. You can set `search = "t"` for search terms in the title only and `search = "tak"` for search terms in the title, abstract, or keywords. For genus-level searches, leave the `species` parameter empty. If you are only interested in knowing how many publications there are, you can run the `Count()` functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Title only; species level
Count(db = "scopus",
      search = "t",
      genus = "Bettongia", species = "penicillata")

#Title, abstract, or keywords; genus level
Count(db = "scopus",
      search = "tak",
      genus = "Bettongia")
```

### :fishing_pole_and_fish: Extracting citaiton records

In order to calculate the indices, you will need to download the citation records. The parameters of `Count()` and `Fetch()` are exactly the same. Let's say you want to compare the species *h*-index of a few marsupials. First, you would need to download the citation information using `Fetch()`. Remember to use binomial names.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Woylie <- Fetch(db = "scopus",
                search = "tak",
                genus = "Bettongia", species = "penicillata")
Quokka <- Fetch(db = "scopus",
                search = "tak",
                genus = "Setonix", species = "brachyurus")
Platypus <- Fetch(db = "scopus",
                  search = "tak",
                  genus = "Ornithorhynchus", species = "anatinus")
Koala <- Fetch(db = "scopus",
               search = "tak",
               genus = "Phascolarctos", species = "cinereus")
```

### :dart: Additional keywords

The `Count()` and `Fetch()` functions allow the addition of keywords using Boolean operators to restrict the domain of the search. Although you can simply use keywords such as "conservation", you will find that using "conserv\*" will yield more results. The "\*" (or wildcard) used here searches for any words with the prefix "conserv", e.g. conservation, conserve, conservatory, etc. Find out more about search language [here](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=980380&p=7089537) and [here](http://schema.elsevier.com/dtds/document/bkapi/search/SCOPUSSearchTips.htm).

### :boar: Synonyms

Some species have had their classification changed in the past, resulting in multiple binomial names and synonyms. Synonyms can be added to the search strings to get the maximum hits. If you have more than 1 synonym, you can parse a list (the list should be named "synonyms") into the argument.

### :bar_chart: Index calculation and plotting

Now that you have the data, you can use the `Allindices()` function to create a dataframe that shows their indices.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Calculate indices
W <- Allindices(Woylie,
                genus = "Bettongia", species = "penicillata")
Q <- Allindices(Quokka,
                genus = "Setonix", species = "brachyurus")
P <- Allindices(Platypus,
                genus = "Ornithorhynchus", species = "anatinus")
K <- Allindices(Koala,
                genus = "Phascolarctos", species = "cinereus")

CombineSp <- dplyr::bind_rows(W, Q, P, K) #combining the citation records
CombineSp
```

Once you are happy with your dataset, you can make some nice plots. Using `plotAllindices()`, we can compare the indices against each other.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plotAllindices(CombineSp)
```

You can also visualise the total publication per year with `getYear()` and `plotPub()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
extract_year_W <- getYear(data = Woylie,
                          genus = "Bettongia", species = "penicillata")
extract_year_Q <- getYear(data = Quokka,
                          genus = "Setonix", species = "brachyurus")
extract_year_P <- getYear(data = Platypus,
                          genus = "Ornithorhynchus", species = "anatinus")
extract_year_K <- getYear(data = Koala,
                          genus = "Phascolarctos", species = "cinereus")
Combine_pub <- rbind(extract_year_W, extract_year_Q, extract_year_P, extract_year_K)
plotPub(Combine_pub)
```

## Concrete example

To see a concrete example, [Tam et al. (2021)](https://ecoevorxiv.org/gd7cv/) has applied this package to study taxonomic bias among mammals by quantifying the scientific interest of 7,521 species of mammals.
